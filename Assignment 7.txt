-- Working with Multiple Tables
-- ADVANCED Problems Using joins, Grouping and Subqueries

--1
No the two tables are not directly related to each other because there are no common columns shared between the two tables.

--2
SELECT student_name, course_title as course_taken, last_name as professor
FROM students s, student_enrollment e, courses c, teach t
WHERE s.student_no = e.student_no
AND c.course_no = e.course_no
AND t.course_no = c.course_no

--3
The student's name is repeated because the student is taking multiple courses.

Similarly the course_no is repeated because the course is being taken by multiple students.

There are also multiple professors teaching the same course such as CS180.

# SELECT student_name, course_title as course_taken, last_name as professor
# FROM students s, student_enrollment e, courses c, (SELECT min(last_name) last_name, course_no FROM teach
# GROUP BY course_no) t
# WHERE s.student_no = e.student_no
# AND c.course_no = e.course_no
# AND t.course_no = c.course_no
--- slight mistakes

SELECT student_name, course_taken, min(professor) FROM
(SELECT student_name, course_title as course_taken, last_name as professor
FROM students s, student_enrollment e, courses c, teach t
WHERE s.student_no = e.student_no
AND c.course_no = e.course_no
AND t.course_no = c.course_no) a
GROUP BY student_name, course_taken

--5
Because in a correlated subquery, the inner query will be executed for each row in the outer query.

In a non-correlated subquery, the subquery is executed only once.

SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, avg_salary from employees e,
(SELECT ROUND(AVG(salary),2) avg_salary, department FROM employees GROUP BY department) t
WHERE t.department = e.department
AND salary > avg_salary

--- correct
SELECT s.student_no, student_name, course_no FROM students s LEFT JOIN student_enrollment e
ON s.student_no = e.student_no

# SELECT student_name, course_no FROM students s, student_enrollment e
# WHERE s.student_no = e.student_no
